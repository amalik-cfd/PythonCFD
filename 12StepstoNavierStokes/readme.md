# 12 Steps to Navier Stokes
 

This repository is showcasing the solutions of NS Equations through the Finite Difference Method, following professor Lorena Barba's course on 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes


## Step 1 : 1D Linear Convection

This step consists of the basic linear convection equation (advection) equation, where a transport variable 'u' (velocity, density, concentration etc) moves across a single dimension with a constant speed 'c'. The quantity also changes with time.
This is one of the building blocks of the NS equations, describing how some quantity changes with time and in space. Its equation is given by 

						du/dt + cdu/dx = 0

## Step 2: 1D Linear Diffusion
This step consists of the 1D diffusion equation of a quantity in space and also wrt time.
						du/dt +cd/dx(du/dx) = 0
